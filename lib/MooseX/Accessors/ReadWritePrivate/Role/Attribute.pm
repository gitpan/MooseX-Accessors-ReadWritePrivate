=head1 NAME

MooseX::Accessors::ReadWritePrivate::Role::Attribute - Names (non Bool) accessors affordance style.

None.  This is part of the implementation of L<MooseX::Accessors::ReadWritePrivate>.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes MooseX::Accessors::ReadWritePrivate::Role::Attribute
version 1.3.0.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role applies a method modifier to the C<_process_options()>
method, and tweaks the reader and writer parameters so that they
end up with affordance names, unless they are C<Bool>s, in which case the
names are semi-affordance.

None.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

None other than what you specify for your attributes.
